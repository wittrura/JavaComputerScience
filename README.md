# Computer Science Exercises in Java

This project was created to implement common and advanced computer science theories in Java. As part of the [Galvanize curriculum](https://www.galvanize.com/austin/web-development), students choose an elective topic to study in the third quarter. I chose to learn Java to round out my skills for a backend systems engineering role, to demonstrate an ability to learn a new language, and to be more comfortable working with a statically typed class-based language (the bulk of the standard curriculum covers Javascript).

## Topics Covered
* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Hash Tables
* Queues, Stacks
* Binary Search Trees
* Graphs

## Algorithms Covered
* Basic Sorting - Bubble, selection, insertion
* Searching - BFS and DFS in graphs
* Advanced Sorting - Merge, quicksort

### Installing

* Install the latest [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* `brew install gradle`

To run code in `src/java/main/Playground.java`:

`gradle run`


### Running the tests

A full test suite is provided in JUnit.

To execute the tests, you can run `gradle test` in the terminal, or make use of testing features in IDE's like intelliJ.
